    <h1>Who I am</h1>
    <p>
      I’ve been developing software for 10 years. I started as an Email
      Marketing coder, moving onto Front-End Website development. Through the
      years I trained myself into Javascript and moved onto NodeJS as a
      Fullstack developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve also specialized in Email Development and Marketing, using systems
      such as Experian Cheetahmail, SalesForce Exact Target, Campaign Monitor
      and MailChimp. Along with building customized microsites and campaigns for
      some of the biggest companies in New Zealand.
